# mac-ibm-enrollment-app
The Mac@IBM enrollment app makes setting up macOS with Jamf Pro more intuitive for users and easier for IT. The application offers IT admins the ability to gather additional information about their users during setup, allows users to customize their enrollment by selecting apps or bundles of apps to install during setup, and provides users with next steps when enrollment is complete.

## Wiki

You can read the [wiki](../../wiki) for instructions on how to adapt the application for your environment.

In order to communicate properly with the Jamf binary, you will need to configure the integration helper prior to the build and archive process. Please see the [XPC communication document](../../wiki/XPC-Communication) for instructions.
